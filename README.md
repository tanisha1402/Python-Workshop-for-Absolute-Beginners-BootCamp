# Python Workshop for Absolute Beginners – BootCamp

This repository contains my hands-on practice from the **Python Workshop for Absolute Beginners BootCamp**.
I completed the sessions, followed along with the workshop videos, and documented my own practice here as proof of learning.

## 📚 Workshop Coverage

The workshop introduced Python fundamentals through step-by-step lessons.
I recreated the examples, solved exercises, and added my own practice code.

Here’s a sample run of the Number Guessing Game (from project.py):

```bash
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 45
Too high! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 23
Too low! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 30
🎉 Correct! You guessed the number in 3 tries.
```
